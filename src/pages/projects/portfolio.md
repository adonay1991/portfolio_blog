This portfolio is developed with astro.build, TypeScript and Solidjs. This website shows my work in different posts, allows you to know more about me and has a section of interesting posts focused on web development, such as tutorials and interesting articles.

To create this website, I decided to use astro.build, a tool that allows you to create web applications quickly and easily using TypeScript. I liked the ease of use of astro.build and the flexibility it offered me to customise my website to my liking. In addition, I decided to use solidjs, to create components and control their states in order to have an excellent harmony between the astro components and the solidjs components.

If you are a frontend developer and you are looking for a tool to create your own portfolio website, I recommend you to have a look at astro.build. It is easy to use, has a great community and allows you to create awesome web applications using TypeScript, solidjs, react, vue and others.

All in all, I am very satisfied with my new portfolio website, developed with astro.build and solidjs, and I hope you like it as much as I do.
