The application I have created using Angular and TypeScript is a parking search engine in Madrid. With this application, users can easily search and find available car parks in the city of Madrid

The application has a friendly and easy to use user interface, which allows users to specify their location and search for nearby car parks. Once users find a car park they are interested in, they can view detailed information about it, including its address, opening and closing hours, and prices.

In addition, the application also allows users to save their favourite car parks.

In summary, our application using Angular and TypeScript is a useful tool for those looking for car parks in Madrid, allowing them to easily find and manage their favourite car parks.
